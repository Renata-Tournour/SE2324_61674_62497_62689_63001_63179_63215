## Use Case Diagram Reviews:
Reviewer's name: Renata Henriques
Subject in review: Europe Management Panel - Use Case Diagram
Review: I believe it's a good use case diagram, but the descriptions of the use cases could be a bit more detailed

## Code Metrics Reviews
Reviewer's Name: Madalena Plácido
Subject in review: MOOD
Review: Due to these metrics not being fully functional in the intelij plugin, this report will later be replaced with one from another metric. Nevertheless the report is very detailed about each metric and compares the results of the diferent metrics with the optimal intervals. Could have mentioned an example of code smell which could be identified with these metrics.
