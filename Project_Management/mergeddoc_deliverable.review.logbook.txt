Created and updated mergeddoc.
Added team member 4's code metric, design patterns, code smells and use case diagrams.
Added the use case diagram for the volcano and its user story.

## Use Case Diagram Reviews: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reviewer's name: Catarina Costa
Subject in review: Use Case Trade Router
Review: The diagram clearly shows the options that the user has
The explanations are clear and to the point

Reviewer's name: Renata Henriques
Subject in review: Europe Management Panel - Use Case Diagram
Review: I believe it's a good use case diagram, but the descriptions of the use cases could be a bit more detailed


## Code Metrics Reviews: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reviewer's Name: Renata Henriques
Subject in review: Chidamber and Kemerer
Review: The document explains all the parameters and provides examples of problematic areas for each parameter.
I believe the report is complete and contains the necessary information.

Reviewer's Name: Madalena Plácido
Subject in review: MOOD
Review: Due to these metrics not being fully functional in the intelij plugin, this report will later be replaced with one from another metric. Nevertheless the report is very detailed about each metric and compares the results of the diferent metrics with the optimal intervals. Could have mentioned an example of code smell which could be identified with these metrics.

Reviewer's Name: Catarina Pedroso
Subject in review: Complexity metrics
Review: Explains the metrics, indicating the different levels and an individual explanations for each parameter. Could explain a little better each parameter.

Reviewer's name: Catarina Costa
Subject in review: Dependency metrics
Review: The document explains every parameter clearly and gives the worst example for each one. 
Explains well the impact of the metric on the whole project, its implications, and how that could lead to the existence of the inappropriate intimacy code smell.

## Design Patterns Reviews: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reviewer's name: Joana Monteiro
Subject in review: Template Method Pattern
Review: The design pattern is  well explained, alongside with a good diagram.

Reviewer's name: Renata Henriques
Subject in review: Facade Pattern
Review: The design pattern is  well explained, the diagram is good.

Reviewer's Name: Catarina Costa
Subject in review: Observer
Review: Identifies the pattern correctly and the different classes/interfaces involved in it.
Gives a good explanation of how the pattern works in the project.

Reviewer's name: Madalena Plácido
Subject in review: Composite
Review: The pattern is well identified in the code and matches class diagram. The text section clearly explains the rationale for identifying this pattern.

Reviewer's name: Catarina Pedroso
Subject in review: Decorator
Review: The pattern is well identified and explained, identifying all the relevant classes.

Reviewer's name: Joana Monteiro
Subject in review: Template
Review: The pattern is well explained and demonstrated not only from the code but also with the diagram.

Reviewer's name: Catarina Pedroso
Subject in review: Observer Pattern
Review: It could include the classes where this observer is used to explain it better.
        The class diagrms would also ilustrate it better.

Reviewer's name: Beatriz Rosas
Subject in review: Facade Pattern
Review: Identifies the facade pattern well.
Add the diagrams class to ilustrate better the pattern.
Show the class that interact with FreeColServer at Client level (the main class).
Include some methods that client class calls from FreeColServer that accesses other classes
(to ilustrate better the wrapper functionality of FreeColServer facade).

Reviewer's name: Madalena Plácido
Subject in review: Template
Review: I think the code snippet of the class "Number" was cut slighly more than it should have. It just missed the getCategory method in the abstract class.
Update: The report now portraits the patterns structure well

Reviewer's name: Renata Henriques
Subject in review: Memento
Review: The pattern is well explained, could have shown more parts of the code snippet.

Reviewer's name: Catarina Costa
Subject in review: Factory Method
Review: Gives a good explanation and shows clearly how it is used in the project

## Code Smells Reviews: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reviewer's name: Joana Monteiro
Subject in review: Long Method
Review: Identified well the code smell, with the help of a good illustration.
The solution is also good.

Reviewer's name: Renata Henriques
Subject in review: Message chain
Review: Identified well the code smell and the solution seems good.

Reviewer's name: Catarina Costa
Subject in review: Data Clumps
Review: Identifies the code smell, shows examples of the problem, and gives a practical solution to it.

Reviewer's name: Catarina Pedroso
Subject in review: Long Method
Review: Explains well why the smell was identified and gives a solution.

Reviewer's name: Madalena Plácido
Subject in review: Data Class
Review: Identifies and explains the data class well and suggest an effective way to solve the smell.

Reviewer's name: Catarina Costa
Subject in review: Data Clumps
Review: Correctly identifies the code smell and gives an easy solution to the problem using code already implemented in the project.

Reviewer's name: Beatriz Rosas
Subject in review: Speculative Generality
Review: Identifies well the code smell.
Gives a practical solution for get rid of it.

Reviewer's name: Madalena Plácido
Subject in review: Long Method
Review: Identifies the long method accurately and suggests an effective way to solve the smell.

Reviewer's name: Renata Henriques
Subject in review: Long parameter list
Review:  Explains well why it's a Long Parameter List (5 parameters), showed the code where it occurs,
and provides a solution. Could have mentioned the number of parameters.

Reviewer's name: Catarina Pedroso
Subject in review: Message Chain
Review: Explains well why the Data Class smell was identified and gives a solution.

Reviewer's name: Beatriz Rosas
Subject in review: Long Method
Review: Identifies the code smell correctly and gives a good solution.
Maybe add the total number of lines of the method.
