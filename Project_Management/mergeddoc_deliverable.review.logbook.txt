## Use Case Diagram Reviews: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reviewer's name: Catarina Costa
Subject in review: Use Case Trade Router
Review: The diagram clearly shows the options that the user has
The explanations are clear and to the point

Reviewer's name: Renata Henriques

## Code Metrics Reviews: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reviewer's Name: Renata Henriques
Subject in review: Chidamber and Kemerer
Review: The document explains all the parameters and provides examples of problematic areas for each parameter.
I believe the report is complete and contains the necessary information.

Reviewer's Name: Madalena Plácido
Subject in review: MOOD
Review: Due to these metrics not being fully functional in the intelij plugin, this report will later be replaced with one from another metric. Nevertheless the report is very detailed about each metric and compares the results of the diferent metrics with the optimal intervals. Could have mentioned an example of code smell which could be identified with these metrics.
