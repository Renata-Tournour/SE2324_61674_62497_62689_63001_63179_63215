Reviewer's name: Catarina Pedroso
Subject in review: Observer Pattern
Review: It could include the classes where this observer is used to explain it better.
        The class diagrms would also ilustrate it better.

Subject in review: Facade Pattern
Review: Identifies the facade pattern well.
Add the diagrams class to ilustrate better the pattern.
Show the class that interact with FreeColServer at Client level (the main class).
Include some methods that client class calls from FreeColServer that accesses other classes
(to ilustrate better the wrapper functionality of FreeColServer facade).
