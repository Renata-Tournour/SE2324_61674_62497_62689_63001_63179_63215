Code Metrics Review

Reviewer's name: Catarina Costa
Subject in review: Joana Monteiro
Review: The document explains every parameter clearly and gives the worst example for each one. 
Explains well the impact of the metric on the whole project, its implications, and how that could lead to the existence of the inappropriate intimacy code smell.
