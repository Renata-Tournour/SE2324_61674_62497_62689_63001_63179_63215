Use Case Diagram Review

Reviewer's name: Beatriz Rosas
Subject in review: Initial Menus - Use Case Diagram
Review: I think it's a good representation of the Initial Menu Panel.
If it makes sense, add more Use Cases that extend Set Preferences (for selecting Audio or Language, for example).
Maybe show more info about the Edit Map Use Case.
